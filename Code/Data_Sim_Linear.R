# Here we create a script to create a data simulation for panel data. 
# We simulate X and Y, having autoregressive effects and a lag-1 crossed effect. 
# X and Y are both affected by a number of confounding variables C, which have stable effects
# over time as they represent time-invariant confounding variables, such as IQ. 
# The data simulation model will have the following properties:
# 1. Each variable will have an innovation (or unexplained variance) such that the total variance of each variable is 1.
# 2. Each variable will have a mean of 0. 
# 3. The autoregressive effects will be set to 0.25 for both X and Y.
# 4. The crossed lag-1 effect of X on Y will be set to 0.1.
# 5. The confounding variables will have effects of 0.2 on X and 0.15 Y.
# 6. The innovations will have residual correlations of 0.3 at each time-point, but not across time-points.
